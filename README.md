<b>Need</b>
>>The unorganized and asynchronous behaviour seen in the buses. 
>>Commoners ending up wasting much time waiting on bus stops.(which is  time and a health issue often)
>>The requirement of knowledge of the buses features like AC/Non AC
>>People do know buses but they do not know the shortest route that they must take. For example,It may be possible that a bus that goes directly from A to C takes more time as compared to a the journey through a bus that goes from A to B and an interchange to a bus that goes from B to C.

<b>Basic MVP Deliverables</b><br>
>>Live Location Tracking
>>Driver Service Account
>>Find Best Route
>Efficient and Native Experience
>>An App that works on both IOS and Android

<b>Major Advantage</b><br>
Rajasthan has been home to the greatest rulers in the world. It has a rich history which is still glorified by the forts present in this eminent state of India.
The forts attract a lot of tourists to Rajasthan. Our app is providing the ease of travelling in Rajasthan. A tourist is thus not confined to hiring a guide to travel pan Rajasthan. A modern day man does have access to Google and can know about facts through it. With this app, he/she is free to go anywhere at his own will since he gets the best route to the designated place. 
This shall be a boost to Tourism Industry and a life changer for a common man of Rajasthan.

<b>Technicalities</b>
>>We shall be collecting the bus stand data from the driver end. The process shall comprise driver clicking the punch button to save the bus stand as and when he stops on it. When companies like Ola can grow into large business houses, even the government can update itself to provide the best of everything to its people
>We use Haversine Formula  to calculate the distance between places for accuracy considering the curvature of the earth
>>We use Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm for calculating the shortest path from start to end location in a computationally fast time
